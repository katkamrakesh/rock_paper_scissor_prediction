**Rock-Paper-Scissor**
Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

**Bayes's Theorem**
Bayes's theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

**Bayes's Theorem formula**

Equivalently, Bayes Theorem can be written as:
posterior = likelihood * prior / evidence

**Working**
The program predicts the next move based on the previous moves, calculating the likelihood for outcomes of rock, paper and scissor.
